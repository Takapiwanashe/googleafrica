#Create a bucket and verify in the Cloud Console
#Open Cloud Shell.
		gsutil mb gs://<BUCKET_NAME>
		
		
#Copy the file into one of the buckets you created earlier in the lab. 
#Replace [MY_FILE] with the file you uploaded and [BUCKET_NAME] with one of your bucket names:
		gsutil cp [MY_FILE] gs://[BUCKET_NAME]
		
o list available regions, execute the following command:

gcloud compute regions list

Create and verify an environment variable
Create an environment variable and replace [YOUR_REGION] with the region you selected in the previous step:

INFRACLASS_REGION=[YOUR_REGION]

Verify it with echo:

echo $INFRACLASS_REGION

Append the environment variable to a file
Create a subdirectory for materials used in this class:

mkdir infraclass

Create a file called config in the infraclass directory:

touch infraclass/config

Append the value of your Region environment variable to the config file:

echo INFRACLASS_REGION=$INFRACLASS_REGION >> ~/infraclass/config

Create a second environment variable for your Project ID, replacing [YOUR_PROJECT_ID] with your Project ID. You can find the project ID on the Cloud Console Home page.

INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]

Append the value of your Project ID environment variable to the config file:

echo INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID=$INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID >> ~/infraclass/config

Use the source command to set the environment variables, and use the echo command to verify that the project variable was set:

source infraclass/config
echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

Close and re-open Cloud Shell. Then issue the echo command again:

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID

There will be no output because the environment variable no longer exists.


Modify the bash profile and create persistence
Edit the shell profile with the following command:

nano .profile

Add the following line to the end of the file:

source infraclass/config

Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

Close and then re-open Cloud Shell to cycle the VM.

Use the echo command to verify that the variable is still set:

echo $INFRACLASS_PROJECT_ID
