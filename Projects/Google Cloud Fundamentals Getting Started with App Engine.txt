#App Engine offers no option to Undeploy an application. After an application is deployed, it remains deployed, 
#although you could instead replace the application with a simple page that says something like "not in service."
#However, you can disable the application, which causes it to no longer be accessible to users.
#In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click App Engine > Settings.
#Click Disable application.
